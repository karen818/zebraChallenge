  <h2>Subways</h2>
  <p>
    There are three major Airports in the New York City area, two of which are in New York and one close by in New Jersey.

If you are coming to New York from out of the country you will most likely be flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) which lies South of the city near Queens. For easy access after your flight to the city itself, you can take the AirTrain. The Airtrain will take travelers straight from the airport to the city and close to main subway and train lines to get you to your destination once inside Manhattan.
